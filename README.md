Artist Statement: as Soon as I realized we were going to be doing swarm behavior, I knew I wanted to create a swarm of fireflies that would lazily bounce around the screen.  I was mostly inspired by the fireflies thast were scrapped from Minecraft.
I think I did a good job making everything work, but I wanted to add a radiant gradient of light around each firefly.
